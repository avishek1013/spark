  /**
   * Run the HITS algorithm for a fixed number of iterations, returning a graph
   * with vertex attributes containing the hub and authority scores. The hub and authority
   * scores range from 0.0 to 1.0. A hub score of 0.0 indicates that the vertex is not a hub
   * (has no outgoing edges) and a score of 1.0 indicates that the vertex is the only hub (all 
   * edges in the graph begin at the vertex). An authority score of 0.0 indicates that the 
   * vertex is not an authority (has no incoming edges) and a score of 1.0 indicates that the 
   * vertex is the only authority (all edges in the graph end at the vertex).
   *
   * The algorithm functions roughly as follows:
   *
   * @tparam VD the original vertex attribute (not used)
   * @tparam ED the original edge attribute (not used)
   *
   * @param graph the graph on which to compute HITS hub and authority scores
   * @param numIter the number of iterations of HITS to run
   *
   * @return the graph containing vertices with their corresponding hub and authority
   *         scores as a vertex attribute (hub, auth) and edges with the same initial edge 
   *         attribute
