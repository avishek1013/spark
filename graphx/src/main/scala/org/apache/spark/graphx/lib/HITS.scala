/**
 * HITS algorithm implementation. The algorithm calculates a hub and authority score for each
 * vertex in a [[Graph]] by iteratively updating the authority value for all vertices and then
 * updating the hub value for all vertices. This is repeated until a set number of iterations
 * have been passed.
 *
 * Psuedocode for the algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * {{{
 * graph := set of vertices and edges
 * // Initialize hub and authority scores
 * for each vertex v in graph do
 *   v.hub = 1.0
 *   v.auth = 1.0
 * 
 * // Loop numIter times
 * iter = 0
 * while iter < numIter do
 *   authNorm = 0.0
 *   // For every vertex, set the authority score to the sum of incoming hub scores
 *   for each vertex v in graph do
 *     v.auth = 0.0
 *     for each vertex u in v.inNbrs do
 *       v.auth += u.hub
 *     authNorm += v.auth * v.auth
 *   
 *   // Normalize each authority score
 *   authNorm = sqrt(authNorm)
 *   for each vertex v in graph do
 *     v.auth /= authNorm
 * 
 *   hubNorm = 0.0
 *   // For every vertex, set the hub score to the sum of outgoing authority scores
 *   for each vertex v in graph do
 *     v.hub = 0.0
 *     for each vertex u in v.outNbrs do
 *       v.hub += u.auth
 *     hubNorm += v.hub * v.hub
 * 
 *   // Normalize each hub score
 *   hubNorm = sqrt(hubNorm)
 *   for each vertex v in graph do
 *     v.hub /= hubNorm
 *
 *   iter += 1
